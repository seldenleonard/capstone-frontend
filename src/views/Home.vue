              <p>
                <strong>Art U</strong> provides a platform for college and
                university student artists to showcase their artworks, represent
                their school, and accrue a following through social engagement
                with other artists, curators, collectors, and everyday art
                consumers. Art U is a space where student artists across the
                United States can connect with a global community.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are a mission-driven organization seeking to uplift the next
                generation of artists whose contributions will undoubtedly
                inspire and create change in our world. The Art U Team is as
                passionate about creating, discovering, sharing, and collecting
                art as our community, and we welcome new members.

                The evolution of art is constant revolution. Art will grow,
                adapt, and exist despite anything, and as a powerful agent of
                change. The rapid, infinite, and decentralized evolution of art
                is ongoing indefinately. Art U simply seeks to facilitate a way
                for those participating to come together and witness this
                process.

                We built this app for a million reasons. Though if you<br />must
                know, I mostly did it to prove that majoring<br />in Art History
                was, in fact, 'a good idea'.
